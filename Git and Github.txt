Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes.
A Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps you manage changes to a project's source code. It allows you to revert back to any previous state of the project.
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a graphical interface and additional features like access control, bug tracking, and wikis for each project.
Some popular Git hosting services are GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
The main types of version control systems are local VCS, centralized VCS, and distributed VCS. Git is an example of a distributed VCS.
Benefits of using Git include: efficient handling of development projects, tracking of changes, ability to work on projects offline, and ease of collaboration.
A Git repository is a directory that contains all of the files necessary for your project, along with the full version history.
To initialize a repository in Git, use the command git init in your project's directory.
